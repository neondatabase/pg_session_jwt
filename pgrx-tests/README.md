# pgrx-tests

Test framework for [`pgrx`](https://crates.io/crates/pgrx/).

Meant to be used as one of your `[dev-dependencies]` when using `pgrx`.

Forked off of pgrx 0.11.3 by Conrad Ludgate for the purposes of adding support for
1. Providing options used for initialising GucContext::Backend
2. Running tests as non-superuser
