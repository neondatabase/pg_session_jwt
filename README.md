pg\_session\_jwt
================

`pg_session_jwt` is a PostgreSQL extension designed to handle authenticated sessions through a JWT. When configured with a JWK (JSON Web Key), it verifies JWT authenticity. When operating without a JWK, it can fall back to using PostgREST-compatible JWT claim parameters.

**JWK can only be set at postmaster startup, from the configuration file, or by client request in the connection startup packet** (e.g., from libpq's PGOPTIONS variable), whereas the JWT can be set anytime at runtime. When a JWK is configured, the extension stores the JWT in the database for later retrieval and exposes functions to retrieve the user ID (the `sub` subject field) and other parts of the payload. When no JWK is configured, it falls back to using the PostgREST-compatible `request.jwt.claim` parameter for user identification.

The goal of this extension is to provide a secure and flexible way to manage authenticated sessions in a PostgreSQL database. The JWTs can be generated by third-party auth providers, and then developers can leverage either the validated JWT (when using JWK) or PostgREST-compatible JWT claims (when not using JWK) for [Row Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) (RLS) policies, or to retrieve the user ID for other purposes (column defaults, filters, etc.).

This extension powers [Neon RLS](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-rls), but it is portable to any Postgres provider or self-managed Postgres deployments.

> This extension is under active development. The API is subject to change.

Features
--------

* **Initialize JWT sessions** using a JWK (JSON Web Key) for secure JWT validation.

* **Flexible authentication modes** - use either JWK-validated JWTs or PostgREST-compatible JWT claims.

* **Retrieve the user ID** or other session-related information directly from the database.

* Simple JSONB-based storage and retrieval of session information.

Usage
-----

The extension can be used in two modes: with JWK validation or with PostgREST-compatible JWT claims.

### Using with JWK Validation

When using JWK validation, you need to initialize the `pg_session_jwt.jwk` parameter before using the extension. This can be done using [libpq connect options](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-OPTIONS):

```console
MY_JWK=...
export PGOPTIONS="-c pg_session_jwt.jwk=$MY_JWK"
```

In this mode, you'll need to:
1. Initialize the session with `auth.init()`
2. Set the JWT using `auth.jwt_session_init(jwt)`
3. Use `auth.user_id()` or `auth.session()` to access the validated JWT data

### Using with PostgREST-compatible JWT Claims

When operating without JWK, the extension works out of the box with PostgREST-compatible JWT claims. No initialization is needed - simply ensure your JWT claims are available as `request.jwt.claim.*` parameters and use `auth.user_id()` to access the subject claim.

This mode provides seamless integration with PostgREST's JWT handling. You can check how PostgREST authentication works in their [docs](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/explanations/db_authz.html).

Functions
--------

`pg_session_jwt` exposes four main functions:

### 1\. auth.init() → void

Initializes a session using JWK stored in `pg_session_jwt.jwk` [run-time parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-show.html). Only needed when using JWK validation mode.

### 2\. auth.jwt\_session\_init(jwt text) → void

Initializes the JWT session with the provided `jwt` as a string. Only needed when using JWK validation mode, where the JWT must be signed by the JWK that was initialized with `auth.init()`.

### 3\. auth.session() → jsonb

Retrieves JWT session data. Only available when using JWK validation mode.

### 4\. auth.user\_id() → text

Returns the user ID associated with the current session. The behavior depends on whether a JWK is defined:

- When JWK is defined:
  - Returns the value from the `"sub"` ("subject") field of the JWT.
  - The JWT must be properly signed and validated.

- When JWK is not defined:
  - Falls back to using the value from PostgREST-compatible `request.jwt.claim.sub` parameter.
  - Returns NULL if `request.jwt.claim.sub` is not set or is empty.

This dual behavior allows for flexible authentication scenarios while maintaining security when JWK is available, and compatibility with PostgREST JWT claims when operating without JWK.
