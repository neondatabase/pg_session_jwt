pg\_session\_jwt
================

`pg_session_jwt` is a PostgreSQL extension designed to handle authenticated sessions through a JWT. This JWT is then verified against a JWK (JSON Web Key) to ensure its authenticity.

**JWK can only be set at postmaster startup, from the configuration file, or by client request in the connection startup packet** (e.g., from libpq's PGOPTIONS variable), whereas the JWT can be set anytime at runtime. The extension then stores the JWT in the database for later retrieval, and exposes functions to retrieve the user ID (the `sub` subject field) and other parts of the payload.

The goal of this extension is to provide a secure and efficient way to manage authenticated sessions in a PostgreSQL database. The JWTs can be generated by third-party auth providers, and then developers can leverage the JWT for [Row Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) (RLS) policies, or to retrieve the user ID for other purposes (column defaults, filters, etc.).

This extension powers [Neon Authorize](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-authorize), but it is portable to any Postgres provider or self-managed Postgres deployments.

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is under active development. The API is subject to change.

Features
--------

* **Initialize JWT sessions** using a JWK (JSON Web Key).

* **Retrieve the user ID** or other session-related information directly from the database.

* Simple JSONB-based storage and retrieval of session information.

Usage
-----

Before calling functions make sure that `pg_session_jwt.jwk` parameter is properly initialized. [libpq connect options](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-OPTIONS) can be used for that.

For example:
```console
MY_JWK=...
export PGOPTIONS="-c pg_session_jwt.jwk=$MY_JWK"
```

`pg_session_jwt` exposes four main functions:

### 1\. auth.init() → void

Initializes a session using JWK stored in `pg_session_jwt.jwk` [run-time parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-show.html). Please remember that this parameter is fixed for a given connection once it's started (but it can vary across different connections)

### 2\. auth.jwt\_session\_init(jwt text) → void

Initializes the JWT session with the provided `jwt` as a string. JWT must be signed by the JWK that was initialized with `auth.init()`

### 3\. auth.session() → jsonb

Retrieves JWT session data.

### 4\. auth.user\_id() → text

Returns the user ID associated with the current session. This is retrieved from the `"sub"` ("subject") field of the JWT.
